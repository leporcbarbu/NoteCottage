These documents were useful during development but are no longer needed at the project root:

- **Completed features** - Now documented in CHANGELOG.md and ROADMAP.md
- **Resolved issues** - Fixed and documented in commit history
- **Deployment guides** - Information integrated into main README.md
- **Development notes** - Historical reference only
